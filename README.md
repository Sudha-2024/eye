# eye

- This HTML document creates a simple interactive eye animation.
  
- The layout includes two eyes, each containing a ball that represents the iris.
  
- As the mouse moves, the balls follow the cursor's position.

- The JavaScript code captures the mouse's coordinates and adjusts the balls' positions accordingly.

- The design relies on an external CSS file, "eye-style.css," for styling.

- This creates an engaging visual effect, simulating eye movement.
